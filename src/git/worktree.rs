/*
* if a user setups the worktree flag, either convert the repo to a git worktree
* or create a new folder prefixed with "bunchOfGits" + repo name that follows 
* the git worktree rules as set out: 
* [worktree tutorial](https://morgan.cugerone.com/blog/how-to-use-git-worktree-and-in-a-clean-way/)
* [worktree tutorial 2](https://dev.to/yankee/practical-guide-to-git-worktree-58o0)
* in the bunch or in the repo config item, set a flag that says this is a worktree
* regardless always check if is worktree or not
